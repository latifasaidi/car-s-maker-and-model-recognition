 Car Models Classification using data set in Kaggle

## Overview
This project uses PyTorch, torchvision package and transfer learning to train pre-trained model to identify the car models.
The pre-trained model use here was ResNet (Residual Neural Network). The [cars dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jutrera/stanford-car-dataset-by-classes-folder) contains 16,185 images of 196 classes of cars.
